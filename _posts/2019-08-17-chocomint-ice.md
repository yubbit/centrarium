This song is way too good for what it is. From the way that the story flows,
down to the way that the dialog blends with the music, it is absolutely 
perfect. It made me crave chocomint-flavored ice cream, but since I'm
currently in Australia, I'll probably have to settle for swallowing a tube of
toothpaste.

The irony isn't lost to me that the story criticizes the kind of
rabid fan obsession that I have for this video. 10/10 Gyari.
