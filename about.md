I'm a masters student in information technology at the University of New South Wales, specializing in artificial intelligence. I may post my notes or experiments here from time-to-time.

I used to work as a financial analyst, running fundamental and macroeconomic analysis for the U.S. markets. Before that, I worked as a business systems analyst in a bank, working with every unit to ensure a smooth and productive overall workflow.

I get my kick out of playing with technology and trying to get things to run just the way I like it. That extends to the real world, and one of the things I want to try out is making a semi-automated herb garden.

In my spare time, I play video games, watch anime, play guitar, and tend to my garden when I'm back at home.
